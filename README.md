# Function of the bacteriophage P2 baseplate central spike Apex domain in the infection process R code

This code was used to produce the figures for the bioarchives paper
"Function of the bacteriophage P2 baseplate central spike Apex domain in the infection process".
I am the first author of this publication and I am the author of this R code.
The data to make these plots has not been published to the public; therefore, all
names for files have been altered and the data files will not be included here.
The publication of this code does not interfere with the publication of the paper;
therefore, I am publishing this code to my portfolio.

Figures made using this code: Figure 3 panels c and d; and Figure 6.b.
